# SpotifyRecordCollection

TODO

- Refresh Token
- Add ability to mark albums as owned (could use local storage, though API in future) - Want to bother? As an enhanced view for Spotify, without this might be fine.
- Display more info, like Label, Release Date etc.
- Add progress bar to loader
- Lazy load images?
