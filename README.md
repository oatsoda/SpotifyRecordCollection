# SpotifyRecordCollection

TODO

- Refresh Token
- Test 401 error works correctly
- Load all albums - with progress bar
- Expand/Contract albums
- Show Album images (possible lazy load too?)
- Colours/Styling
- Add ability to mark albums as owned (could use local storage, though API in future) - Want to bother? As an enhanced view for Spotify, without this might be fine.
- Display more info, like Label, Release Date etc.
- Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline
