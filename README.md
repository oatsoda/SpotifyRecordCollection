# SpotifyRecordCollection

TODO

- Refresh Token
- Colours/Styling
  - Especially Auth button
- Add ability to mark albums as owned (could use local storage, though API in future) - Want to bother? As an enhanced view for Spotify, without this might be fine.
- Display more info, like Label, Release Date etc.
- Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline
  - Base URL for passing to OAuth redirect
- Album sorting to exclude 'The' and other prefixes
- Add progress bar to loader
- Lazy load images?
